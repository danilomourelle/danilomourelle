# Hey there! 👋

### whoami 🙋‍♂️
I'm a Brazilian web developer since 2020 and I've taken a long journey to get here today.

I first started my professional life with a Biology degree. I'm fascinated by discovering how things work, and what's more fascinating than life itself? Well, unfortunately, it didn't turn out very well, so I decided to make a course correction and come to the tech area.

To keep my options open, I decided to enroll in a Mechatronics degree when I first encountered programming. Yes, the focus was far from web programming, but it was the spark I needed at the moment. After a short period of programming robots - not like Boston Dynamics (I wish) - I finally dove into the web *Hello* World.

### Current Position 💼
Today, I'm working at [Icaro Technologies](https://icarotech.com/) as a senior back-end developer and I'm the current Node advocate at my chapter. My main stack for projects is Node.js with TypeScript. I've worked on two projects: a chatbot and a mobile app. Both projects aim to help field technicians by providing ticket information and assisting with troubleshooting. 


### Techs I already have some knowledge 📚
I've made significant strides in my technical skills over the years. I've deepened my understanding of Git, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js. Additionally, I've gained proficiency in PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes. 

In terms of coding practices, I've honed my architectural skills and recognized the crucial role of automated testing during development. As for version control, I've become familiar with GitLab and its powerful CI/CD tools.

### Short-Term Goals 🎒
To expand my skill set, I'm eager to learn front-end technologies and become a full-stack developer. This would significantly enhance my career prospects. Additionally, I'm interested in acquiring knowledge in Java, given its widespread use.

### Long-Term Goals 🔭
While I don't have a strict timeline, I'm passionate about pursuing AI knowledge as I believe it will be a crucial skill in the future of development. Python serves as a solid foundation for this endeavor.

Staying true to my roots, I'm also intrigued by the potential of Deno. Given that a second version of software often surpasses its predecessor, Deno can benefit from learning from Node.js's shortcomings and implementing improvements.
